    "**B.** Construct a binary indicator variable for male score > female score  for each year - for full credit, do so without repeating the difference code for each of the four years: name these according to following convention: `outcome_male_higher_female_year` where year is 2013, 2015, 2017, or 2019 (e.g., 2013: `outcome_male_higher_female_2013`). After this, remove the raw math scores as columns in the data (so filter out any column with the word math)\n",
    "\n",
    "**C.** Melt the data (`acs_wmath`) to long where instead of wide years, years are repeated within state; the ACS vars will also be repeated since we only pulled one year. In other words, reshape the data from \"wide format\", where each state is a row and we have separate columns for each year, to \"long format\", where states are repeated four times: once for each year in the data (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019). With 50 states, your final shape should be (200,84).\n",
